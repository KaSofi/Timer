Steck: React (using class components)

This project was written to explore the "component lifecycle" in React.
To write the timer app, I used the componrntDidMount() and componentWillUnMount() methods.
I used the componrntDidMount() method during the mounting stage. To write a timer, the componrntDidMount() method must be used to stop the timer, at the last phase of the life cycle, called unmounting.
